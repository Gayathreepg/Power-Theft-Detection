# Power-Theft-Detection
Problem Statement
A few energy companies are experiencing significant losses in their lines, such as
Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). To predict customers involved in any
fraudulent activities and detect anomalies, the billing team requested the
development of a management learning application (MLOps).

In a meeting with the management team of the energy company, it was
suggested that the machine learning model be trained and tested with a
variety of data sets as needed. As a result, business users should be able to
upload training data to MLOps and select features through the user interface
(UI). Users should also be able to upload and preview test data to test the
model. Explanations AI functionality should be implemented by MLOps to help
business users understand what the model outcomes mean. To simplify and
better understand model outcomes, business users requested visual data
analysis functionality.
